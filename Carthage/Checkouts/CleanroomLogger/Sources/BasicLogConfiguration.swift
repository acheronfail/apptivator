     will not be passed to the receiver's `recorders`.

     - parameter filters: The `LogFilter`s to use when deciding whether a given
     `LogEntry` should be passed along to the receiver's `LogRecorder`s.

     - parameter recorders: The `LogRecorder`s to use for recording any 
     `LogEntry` that has passed the filtering process.

     - parameter synchronousMode: Determines whether synchronous mode will be
     used when passing `LogEntry` instances to the receiver's `recorders`.
     Synchronous mode is helpful while debugging, as it ensures that logs are
     always up-to-date when debug breakpoints are hit. However, synchronous 
     mode can have a negative influence on performance and is therefore not
     recommended for use in production code.
     
     - parameter configurations: Optional `LogConfiguration`s. For
     organizational purposes, a given `LogConfiguration` may in turn contain
     one or more additional `LogConfiguration`s. Note that these are handled
     as entirely separate entities; the receiver's state does not affect the
     behavior of the contained configurations in any way.
