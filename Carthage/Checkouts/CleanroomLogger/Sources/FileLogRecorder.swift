/**
 A `LogRecorder` implementation that appends log entries to a file.

 - note: `FileLogRecorder` is a simple log appender that provides no mechanism
 for file rotation or truncation. Unless you manually manage the log file when
 a `FileLogRecorder` doesn't have it open, you will end up with an ever-growing
 file. Use a `RotatingLogFileRecorder` instead if you'd rather not have to
 concern yourself with such details.

     Attempts to initialize a new `FileLogRecorder` instance to use the
     given file path and log formatters. This will fail if `filePath` could
     not be opened for writing.

     - parameter filePath: The path of the file to be written. The containing
     directory must exist and be writable by the process. If the file does not
     yet exist, it will be created; if it does exist, new log messages will be
     appended to the end of the file.

     - parameter formatters: An array of `LogFormatter`s to use for formatting
     log entries to be recorded by the receiver. Each formatter is consulted in
     sequence, and the formatted string returned by the first formatter to
     yield a non-`nil` value will be recorded. If every formatter returns `nil`,
     the log entry is silently ignored and not recorded.
