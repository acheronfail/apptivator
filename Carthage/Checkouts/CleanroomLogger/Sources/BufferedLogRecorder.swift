/**
 The `BufferedLogRecorder` is a generic `LogRecorder` that buffers the log
 messages passed to its `record()` function.
 
 Construction requires a `createBufferItem` function, which is responsible
 for converting the `LogEntry` and formatted message `String` into the
 generic `BufferItem` type.
 
 Three specific subclasses are also provided which will buffer a different
 `BufferItem` type for each call to `record()`:
 
 - `BufferedMessageRecorder` stores `String`s containing the formatted log
 message.
 - `BufferedLogEntryRecorder` stores the `LogEntry` values passed to `record()`.
 - `BufferedLogEntryMessageRecorder` stores a `(LogEntry, String)` tuple
 containing the `LogEntry` and formatted log message.

     log entries to be recorded by the receiver. Each formatter is consulted in
     sequence, and the formatted string returned by the first formatter to
     yield a non-`nil` value will be recorded. If every formatter returns `nil`,
     the log entry is silently ignored and not recorded.

     - parameter bufferLimit: If this value is positive, it specifies the
     maximum number of items to store in the buffer. If `record()` is called
     when the buffer limit has been reached, the oldest item in the buffer will
     be dropped. If this value is zero or negative, no limit will be applied.

     consumption will grow endlessly unless you manually clear the buffer
     periodically.

     a new queue will be created.
